I am a PhD Candidate in Biophysics at the University of Chicago. I study protein physics combining molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning algorithms and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Recently, I took a machine learning class with professor John Lafferty at the University of Chicago (Now at Yale), and I really enjoyed getting lost in the data and finding new insights. I decided to fully pursue a job in data science + consulting, which is where I am now.

Aside from work I really enjoy playing basketball, soccer and a little bit of rock climbing. My all-time favorite show is The Office, and I am a big fan of Michael Scott.
