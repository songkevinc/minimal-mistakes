I am a PhD Candidate in Biophysics at the University of Chicago. I study membrane protein physics combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning algorithms, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Generally, I enjoy problem solving, programming and playing with data. Recently, I took a machine learning class with professor John Lafferty at UChicago (Now at Yale) and enjoyed learning both the theories and using popular machine learning algorithms to find interesting insights in our datasets (MNIST, Supernovae, State of the Union Addresses, etc.). I'm looking to transition from academia to data science + consulting.

Aside from my professional interests, I really enjoy playing basketball, soccer and a little bit of rock climbing. I'm an amateur photographer and have been taking portraits for students in my graduate program for our [website](https://biophysics.uchicago.edu/the-students/). My ideal vacation spots will either include good food or good camping spots. I'm an avid fan of The Office, and a podcast junkie.
